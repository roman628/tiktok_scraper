- NEVER write fallbacks
- Design personal diagnostic tools to comprehensively understand system mechanics:
  * Create step-by-step tracing mechanisms
  * Implement verbose logging for each component
  * Build interactive debug interfaces
  * Develop recursive error analysis tools
  * Construct dependency mapping visualizations
