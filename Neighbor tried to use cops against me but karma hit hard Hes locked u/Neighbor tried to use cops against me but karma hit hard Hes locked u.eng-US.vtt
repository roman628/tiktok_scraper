00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:01.460
My neighbor weaponized the police

00:00:01.461 --> 00:00:03.041
thanks to his connections.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.500
Now he's the one behind bars,

00:00:04.501 --> 00:00:06.221
and I'm finally free. For years,

00:00:06.222 --> 00:00:09.241
I lived next to a man who made it his mission to make my life hell.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.340
It started small, petty noise complaints,

00:00:11.341 --> 00:00:12.781
passive aggressive comments,

00:00:12.782 --> 00:00:15.401
dirty looks. I brushed it off at first,

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.420
but when the fake police reports started,

00:00:17.421 --> 00:00:20.661
everything changed. He claimed I was blasting music at all hours.

00:00:20.662 --> 00:00:22.701
I wasn't, that I was illegally dumping trash.

00:00:22.702 --> 00:00:24.061
My bins were always sealed,

00:00:24.062 --> 00:00:26.341
and even accused me of running some kind of shady business

00:00:26.342 --> 00:00:28.421
out of my garage. At first,

00:00:28.422 --> 00:00:29.741
the cops seemed skeptical,

00:00:29.742 --> 00:00:31.301
but then I started noticing a pattern.

00:00:31.302 --> 00:00:33.621
They always showed up. They always believed him first.

00:00:33.622 --> 00:00:35.381
And sometimes they came with attitude,

00:00:35.382 --> 00:00:37.001
like they were expecting a criminal.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.020
I later Learned that his cousin was a sergeant at the local precinct,

00:00:40.021 --> 00:00:42.161
and a couple of his golf buddies were beat cops.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.960
He bragged about it when he got drunk at backyard parties.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.140
No one believed me

00:00:46.141 --> 00:00:48.381
when I said he was using his connections to target me.

00:00:48.382 --> 00:00:50.481
Until karma finally did what it does best.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.720
The nightmare lasted nearly four years.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.460
I had to install security cameras

00:00:54.461 --> 00:00:57.281
just to prove I wasn't doing the things I was being accused of.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.340
Every few months,

00:00:58.341 --> 00:01:00.621
I'd get a visit from the police over some bogus complaint.

00:01:00.622 --> 00:01:02.861
Excessive noise, suspicious activity,

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:05.001
or some nonsense about zoning violations.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.060
I documented everything. Every time they showed up.

00:01:08.061 --> 00:01:10.741
Every time I was spoken to like a criminal in my own home.

00:01:10.742 --> 00:01:13.601
Every time, I had to defend myself for just living my life.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.320
Then the tide started to turn.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.220
A new officer showed up one day,

00:01:17.221 --> 00:01:19.561
and unlike the others, she was respectful.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.620
She took one look at my setup and said,

00:01:21.621 --> 00:01:23.741
this doesn't add up. Turns out

00:01:23.742 --> 00:01:25.341
she had transferred from another department

00:01:25.342 --> 00:01:27.161
and wasn't part of the local boys club.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.260
I showed her the video evidence I had,

00:01:29.261 --> 00:01:31.261
including a clip of my neighbor standing on his porch

00:01:31.262 --> 00:01:33.341
calling the police, then grinning and mouthing,

00:01:33.342 --> 00:01:35.581
watch this. She told me to hold on to it

00:01:35.582 --> 00:01:38.041
and quietly pass the information to internal affairs.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.200
From there, a slow but steady investigation began.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.000
Over the next year, the IA team dug deep.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.420
Not only was my neighbor filing fake reports,

00:01:46.421 --> 00:01:48.821
but his cousin at the precinct had been manipulating paperwork

00:01:48.822 --> 00:01:50.361
and fast tracking his complaints.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.860
Other neighbors started to come forward with their own stories.

00:01:52.861 --> 00:01:54.841
Turns out I wasn't the only one.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.200
A quiet little scandal began to unravel.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.460
Eventually, both the cousin and another officer were suspended

00:02:00.461 --> 00:02:03.381
and my neighbor arrested for filing false reports,

00:02:03.382 --> 00:02:06.521
harassment, and conspiracy to misuse police resources.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.260
Watching him get LED away in cuffs

00:02:08.261 --> 00:02:10.441
was the most peaceful moment I'd had in years.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.800
And now the quiet is blissful.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.560
No more late night sirens.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.440
No more pounding on my door.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.200
No more fear. I repainted my house,

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.540
planted a garden. I even adopted a Dog.

00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:23.261
Something I never would have dared before

00:02:23.262 --> 00:02:25.681
for fear he'd try to get it taken away with a complaint.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.420
They say karma takes its time,

00:02:27.421 --> 00:02:29.681
but when it hits, it hits hard.
