    "subtitle_transcription": "What disturbing rumor turned out to be true at your school? When I was a senior in high school, we had a new teacher join the faculty to teach health and home economics. She was probably about 26 years old and very, very attractive. Everyone was talking about the hot new teacher. As I was senior class president, I needed a new faculty advisor since my previous advisor of 3 years retired at the end of my junior year. About 2 weeks later, the principal called me into his office and informed me that the new hot teacher was going to be our new class advisor for the rest of the year. As a result, she and I spent a lot of time together at school and off campus organizing and running myriad events to raise money for the class, plan the prom, field trips, etc. Soon the rumors started flying around that she and I were messing around. This was completely false. I can say she never acted inappropriately towards me or suggested anything to make me think she had plans for any type of physical or sexual activity. She was a fantastic advisor and always just that, a class advisor. I spent the rest of the year denying these rumors with friends, with teachers, and with parents. I was even interrogated by my wrestling coach the day before the district championship match. She and I had a laugh about it at graduation as she had to face similar Questions from other faculty as well as the principal. She confided in me that she had tendered her resignation, but the principal would not accept it and said he believed her and would ensure the rumor was squashed. So I graduated and left for my Plea beer at West Point, forgetting about the entire situation. At West Point, the first year is called Plea Beer rather than freshman year. The first semester of my Plea beer was moving along as it should, with no unusual events worth mentioning until the final month. Then, in early December, the topic of my high school faculty advisor resurfaced. One night when I was studying, there was a knock on my door in the company tactical officer. A regular army captain walked in and told me to report to his office immediately, as there was a phone call from the Dover Police Department. Now, I immediately assumed it was my brother playing some kind of twisted joke on me, since he was a captain in the very same police department, waiting for me on the phone. Since my attack was standing right behind me, I answered the phone as we were taught. Cadet Kerwick speaking. How may I help you, sir slash ma'am? I immediately recognize the voice on the other end. It was not my brother, but a close friend I had grown up with and known for over 15 years. He said,",

    "subtitle_transcription": "I accidentally sent a bikini photo to my arch nemesis, Parker. He replied almost instantly, comma, you're at a hotel this late? Comma, are you with another man? Comma. I already found out which hotel you're at. I'll be there in an hour and a half. Wait for me. Before I could explain, I heard Parker's voice at the door open up. I hadn't even finished reading his messages and he was already at my door with a dark expression. I opened the door. He scanned me from head to toe warily. I was wearing a bathrobe and he was holding a baseball bat. That photo was sent to the wrong person. Before I could finish speaking, Parker stormed into the room. He searched the place thoroughly, even looking through the trash can. What are you looking for? I'm looking for that bastard, Parker said angrily. Don't tell me you came to the hot springs alone and dressed so little. I rolled my eyes. Who comes to the hot springs alone? then the man who brought you here after only knowing you for a week to a hot spring hotel is definitely not a good guy. After finding nothing, Parker turned to me holding the baseball bat and asked, where's that bastard hiding? I pointed to the next room. He immediately started heading toward the door. I lazily said, I came with my parents. They're in the next room. Parker threw the baseball bat into the trash. He plopped Down on the sofa. Why didn't you say you came with your parents earlier? Should I go next door to say hello? It feels rude to come empty handed. I rolled my eyes. Can't you bring a baseball bat? It's late. My parents are already asleep. Parker's mom is friends with my mom. So can you leave now? I gave him a couple of punches, but he just smiled at me playfully. But now there are no available rooms. And if I drive back in two and a/2 hours, I'm afraid I'll fall asleep at the wheel. Looking at his tired expression, it didn't seem fake and I softened. Ugh, fine. You can sleep on the couch. As it turns out, you should never soften your heart, especially with an enemy. Are you asleep? Really asleep? Parker, sleeping on the couch, asked me a question every two minutes. I kept my eyes closed and pretended to be asleep, ignoring him. Can't be asleep, huh? I couldn't take it anymore. Are you crazy? Parker Grant, when you slept with me as a kid, you'd grind your teeth like you were chewing someone. It was terrifying. Can you not bring up something from when I was 3? I'm tired. I want to sleep. I can't sleep. This couch is too short. I can't stretch my legs. I ignored him and turned over to sleep. Parker spoke again. Hey, I forgot to ask you, who were you originally sending that bikini photo to with that Tiny bit of fabric. What's it supposed to cover? I rolled my eyes, even with my eyes closed, and muttered angrily, none of your business. I've watched you grow up. How can I not care? His voice was right next to my ear and I jumped in shock. I opened my eyes and saw Parker shirtless with a blanket wrapped around him, standing at the edge of my bed. What the hell are you doing? I jumped up from the bed. Why are you so close? All of a sudden, he stared at me with a cold expression, demanding. Then tell me, who did you send it to? I sent it to sky. Okay. Sky is one of my good friends and Parker knows him. He threw the blanket on the floor beside my bed and said, should have said so earlier. I was so irritated by him, I had no desire to sleep anymore. Parker, does that bikini look really bad on me? Yeah, it doesn't look good. Fine. Since you think it looks bad, I'm sure my senior won't like it either. Parker, already lying down, immediately sat up. What do you need to wear that for? Say it again. I knew he'd get anxious. Whenever there was any chance I might be getting attention from someone, Parker would be the most anxious of all. I smiled mischievously. I'm going to the beach with my senior. Parker was furious. That guy from the student council, that guy with The gold rimmed glasses. I remember him. He doesn't look like a good person. You're still going to the beach with him. Then came the sound of footsteps. Pacing back and forth. That swimsuit with almost no fabric. I swear you're really asking for trouble. Say something. I felt a little smug answering lazily, I'm asleep. Turn around. Parker threw off the blanket. Grab. He grabbed me and turned me toward him. No sleeping. He was so close to me. His hands pressing down on both sides of my head. Since we stopped fighting when we were 10, this was the first time we were this close and he was shirtless. We both froze. After a long silence, I spoke first. Why is your face so red?",

    "subtitle_transcription": "My mum abandoned my dad and me when I was a baby because she wanted to live her life more without being held back. Now 14 years later, she wants to reconnect. Posted by u slash lazy underscore scale 2633 I 16f am living with my dad who has 100 percent sole custody of me. He has had custody since I was 2. My parents had me when they were quite young. My dad was 18 and my mum was 20. And mum couldn't cope with how my existence inconvenienced her education and social life. She wanted to enjoy university and my existence got in the way of all of that. Therefore, she up sticks and left my dad to raise me by himself. And my dad is the complete opposite and has more worth in one of his pinky fingers than her entire existence. He has been both the mother and the father in my life. He has showered me with the love and affection that I needed. He has been strict with me when needed and has guided me to be the person that I am today. And he has never missed a day or an opportunity to let me know how much he loves me. He is my hero and I doubt that I will ever love anyone else as much as I do my dad. I am unashamed to admit that I am a daddy's girl. Our life has been very stable and he has done An amazing job of raising me throughout my childhood and into my teenage years. But now the egg donor, I won't apologize for calling her that because just the thought of calling her mum turns my stomach is trying to rock the boat. She's contacted me asking if we could meet up because she wants to reconnect with me. She gave a sob story about how she spent years regretting her decision not to be in my life and how she's now at a point in her life mentally and financially where she wants to give me what I am owed from her. She also has two children, 7 and 5, and she is hopeful that I can develop a relationship with my siblings. This is where I feel that I might have been a jerk because in an outburst of sudden anger at being contacted, I told her to f off and that nothing she says could convince me to have anything to do with someone I only consider to be an egg donor and incubator in my life. I thought I had given up my anger and resentment towards her a long time ago, but it felt like the dam broke as I let out all of that anger and resentment that had built up over the years, unleashing all of my pent up feelings toward her. Because the anger that I felt wasn't only for myself and how she abandoned me. I also felt anger for the Hurt, pain and struggle she caused my dad and here she is trying to reopen those old wounds that both my dad and I have suffered at her selfish hands. I told her all of that and how I consider myself to be the child of one parent as the other one has been dead for most of my life. I'm not ashamed to admit that I took some joy in telling her how amazing a father and man my dad is and that both my dad and I had a lucky escape getting away from someone as narcissistic and toxic as she is. And the only point where I remained somewhat civil was when I told her that I don't want anything to do with her children because despite my anger and resentment toward her, those children are blameless and innocent and if she tries to use them as an emotional weapon against me or selfishly drags them into all of this, then that would only make me angrier than I already am. I blocked her from all of my socials, though I know this won't be over anytime soon and my dad is preparing to lawyer up if she does try to drag this to the courts. But for now, I'm going to try and refocus on my GCSE exams and look forward to the upcoming trip away with my dad to celebrate the end of my exams. Top slash relevant comments, commenter, not the jerk. Really you Did what any sane person would do after years of neglect. And to be honest, you deserve a medal because it takes a lot of courage to stand up for yourself. I hope you find a way to move forward with peace of mind and a renewed sense of strength. Opps response, thankfully, my dad has a big heart and he has given me the love of two parents. I doubt that I'd have the courage to stand up for myself if it wasn't for the way he's raised me. Comment or two, she's waited 14 years to contact you while she's had other kids for, what, seven years? Nah, she could have reached out at any point. The fact that she waited until you're old enough to babysit is suspicious as hell. You owe her nothing. OP's response, she tried reaching out last year by contacting my dad. He spoke to me at the time about it, asked what I wanted to do, and he respected my decision of not wanting anything to do with her. He gave my response to her, but she's now bypassed him and contacted me directly. Downvoted commenter, I can't stop wondering who told you the reasons for her leaving. If it's not her, I would like to hear the reason from her own mouth. Opps response, she told me herself as part of her sob story, it was always difficult for my dad to give an appropriate response whenever I did ask him. Why she left us, but he did his very best to tell me in an age appropriate way. Is there any chance that Ops dad can ask for child support if her mom is in a better place financially? My dad isn't struggling for money and he's been placing money into a fund that I use for uni expenses. The topic of back payments on child support has come up, but I am reluctant to accept any money from her as I don't want to give her a reason to believe that she now has the right to have a say in my life just because we've accepted money from her. Update one month, 3 weeks later. This is an update on a post that I made more than a month ago. Editor's note, I'll recap her previous post here. So I am fast forwarding to the new information. She's made a few attempts over the last couple of years to reenter my life. Her first attempt was through my dad and when he spoke to me about it, I told him that I didn't want to know her. He returned that message to her. The most recent attempt occurred the other month, only this time she bypassed my dad and messaged me directly. I admittedly blew up at her and took a lot of my frustrations out on her. Eventually though, she respected the fact that I needed to concentrate on my GCSE's and she asked if we could Meet up after I was done. I then spent a while trying to figure out what I should do. I spoke to my dad about it and he gave me his full support on whatever my decision would be. In the end, I did agree to meet my mum in a public place and we met up yesterday at a coffee shop. My dad dropped me off and I asked him to stay close by to pick me up when I was done. he went and did a bit of shopping for our upcoming trip away together. I understand that this is getting to be quite a long read now so I will try to keep it as simple as possible. Basically my mum started giving me an emotional story about how she has spent the last 10+ years regretting not being in my life. She told me that she was young when she walked out and was really unsure what she wanted in life. I responded that I can understand she was young and that becoming a mum at her age must have been incredibly difficult. But I pointed out that my dad was also young, actually younger than her in fact, yet he stepped up and became a single parent to the detriment of his own future dreams and relationships. So whilst I could sympathize with her, I still couldn't accept that as being a good enough reason. I could see that those words really stung her. And while I knew she was being genuine, I still couldn't forgive her for that. And I did tell her that. She then informed me that her children, my half siblings, would really like to meet their older sister. And she showed me their photos and told me stories about their lives. This honestly felt like a stab to the heart because a mum talking about her children, sharing photos of them, etc, is what I spent my life wanting. In the end, I had to ask her to stop talking about her children because hearing these stories was bringing up the pain of the mum that I always wanted but never had. I also told her that no matter how much she tries, I will never see her children as my siblings. We didn't grow up together and we don't know each other. They are nothing but strangers to me and no different from the children I see walking past me in the street. My emotions got the better of me at this point and my mum saw my agitation growing. I won't bore you with everything that was said. But by the time we were done with our conversation and getting ready to leave, my mum got the wrong impression, thinking that this wouldn't be the last time we'd meet. She thanked me for giving her this opportunity to spend time with her eldest daughter and said she hoped we could continue to heal our relationship. I had To stop her there. And this is where I'm now second guessing whether I was too harsh because I told her that under no false illusion does this mean we will one day have a mother slash daughter relationship. I only gave her this time with me so that we could both say what needed to be said for the closure that would allow us to move on from each other. I don't now and never will consider her to be my mum. Yes, she is the woman who gave birth to me and I will always be thankful to her for carrying me for 9 months and giving birth to me. However, that doesn't mean that I will ever see her as my mum. She began to get rather emotional at this point, but I had to ignore that so I could finish what I wanted to say. I told her that I consider myself to have only one parent, my dad. And before we went our separate ways, while she was still trying to get her emotions under control and begging me to reconsider giving her a second chance, I felt that I had to be brutally honest. I requested that she not contact me or my dad again and that if I ever wanted to speak to her again, I would be the one to reach out. I'm not heartless. The pain was honestly eating away at me as I watched my mum getting more and more Emotional and I was struggling to keep my own emotions under control. I wanted to cry, but I couldn't. I knew I had to make my message crystal clear to her that I don't want anything to do with her, not now or anytime in the future. It was only when I met up with my dad and got into the car that I finally broke down and cried hysterically. My dad has given me his full support. He's reassured me that he'll always respect my decision, whether I want my mum in my life, whether I want to go low contact or completely remove her from my life, he will always support me. And I really appreciate that. His support has reassured me that I've done the right thing. However, while speaking to my best friends, they've been conflicted on the matter. They feel I was too harsh on my mom and that I should have been more responsive to repairing a relationship with her. They believe I should try to give her a second chance, otherwise I might one day regret it. I asked them to change the subject because I didn't want to talk about her anymore. But it did leave me wondering whether I was too harsh on my mum when she was trying to give me a genuine apology for all of her wrongdoing. She has accepted full responsibility for what she did and acknowledged that there is nothing that could excuse her actions. 14 Years ago. That makes me feel like my friends were right and that I was a jerk to my mum when we met up but I'm just confused right now. My dad has offered me the chance to see a therapist for everything I've been through but I'm reluctant. I'm foolishly hoping that once I've been on this holiday with my dad and we return home, these events with my mum will be in the distant past. Oh, and to finish off, in my last post I had a number of comments telling me that my dad should chase my mum for child support. I did discuss this with my dad but it's not something he wants to do. He says that we're fine financially and he doesn't want to deal with the stress of going through the legal system which can be slow and ending up in a prolonged legal battle with her. He's also concerned that this might give my mum more incentive to try to forcibly be more involved in my life because she's now invested money into me and that could give her a legal right to some form of access to me. Top relevant comments, commenter, she said she regretted the last 10+ years of not being in your life but didn't even contact you once until now. She made her bed when she abandoned you. Now let her sleep in it. Actions have consequences. Opps response, she's made a few attempts over the last Few years, but I always made it clear each time that I didn't want to have contact with her. I only agreed to meet up with her yesterday with the intention of telling her that I don't want her in my life regardless of what she had to say. But seeing her get as emotional as she did hit me in a way I didn't expect. Commenter 2, wow, talk about throwing it in your face when she described her children, you know, the one she wanted to be a mother to. Some things can never be fixed no matter how hard you wish it. And that's a lesson your egg donor is learning. OP's response, I know she was just hoping I might want to have a connection with my half siblings, but it was incredibly hurtful the way she brought them up in the conversation. She could have gone about addressing them with me in a much better way. And it's not like I'm 100% against the idea of knowing them one day, but I couldn't do it while they're still living at home and under the influence of their mum. Comment or three, if she had regrets 10 years ago when you were 6, then a mother daughter relationship might have happened if she was introduced slowly and given a chance to build that bond. This isn't what's happening here. She's expecting an almost adult to be falling over herself at the chance to have a relationship. With her and her family. That's why she's already told her kids about their big sister who they're now excited to meet. Any rational person would build a relationship with you first before bringing in more people with expectations you never signed up for. I do think speaking to someone is a good idea if you're not comfortable with that journal opps response. That's the really sad thing. Up until around the age of 10 to 12, I was still hoping for a chance for my mum to reenter my life. I would have welcomed her back. That little girl inside me would have forgiven her. But I'm almost an adult now. My dad has done the hard graft of raising me and getting me through school. My childhood is over and it's too late for her. Now I'm receptive to the possibility of one day forming some kind of relationship with my half siblings because I can't hold them accountable for their mum's past behaviour towards me. But I couldn't do it before. We're all adults and they're no longer under the control of their mum. Commenter 4. So at 20, she was too young for a baby, but your dad wasn't. Your mum wants something. Maybe her new family or in laws found out about you and questioned how she has no contact. Honestly, you did the absolute right thing for you. You got closure and saw her one last time. She had all those wonderful stories about Her kids, but she probably couldn't even tell you your favourite colour. Not saying that to hurt. Just for clarity, she is not your mum. She's the person who gave birth to you. A mum is someone who raises you, sweats, bleeds and agonizes over every decision about you, worries about you and what you're doing. This woman didn't do any of that. Your dad did and still does. Kudos to your dad for being a man when he could have run. Opps response. My dad said the same thing. My maternal grandparents were both deceased before I was born, which is why they aren't in the picture. But word of my existence probably got out to her husband's family. A mum is someone who raises you, sweats, bleeds and agonizes over every decision about you, worries about you and what you're doing. And this is why I show appreciation to my dad on both Mother's Day and Father's Day because he took on the duty of being both my mother and father, including certain stages of a daughter's life where a mum is traditionally needed. He has enough love to ensure that I've never gone without up on her father trying to keep her mother updated on her life. My dad would always share updates on my life milestones, first day of school, my birthdays, etc. But she never showed interest in the updates that my dad sent her. She blanked my entire existence. So birthday and Christmas presents. From her were never a thing. I've had people previously warned me that if I decided to make a connection with my mum and spend time with her, it would hurt my dad's feelings. But rest assured, there is nothing she could offer that would make me want to spend time connecting with her, let alone make me want to choose her over my dad. Because I'm not the only person she hurt with her selfish actions. My dad struggled a lot and I saw many of his struggles growing up. He did his best to hide them from me, but I saw them. And every time I saw he was upset, I'd always give my dad a cuddle and then I love you. And I'd always feel a great sense of happiness when I saw how happy that made him. I could never forgive the person who caused all that struggle and pain for my dad. It's my daily habit. I don't miss a day when it comes to giving my dad a hug and telling him that I love him.",

    "subtitle_transcription": "I heard music coming from the attic. I live in an apartment with no attic. The melody first drifted down to me on a Tuesday night while I was washing dishes. Soft piano music, something classical, filtering through my kitchen ceiling, like it was coming from the apartment above. Except I live on the top floor of a three story building. I turned off the water and listened. The music was definitely coming from overhead. Delicate, melancholy notes that seemed to echo in a larger space than any apartment should contain. I grabbed a step ladder and pressed my ear to the ceiling. The music was clearer now, accompanied by footsteps pacing slowly across a wooden floor. My building on Elm Street was converted from a Victorian house in the 1940s. The third floor had originally been attic space, retrofitted with proper insulation. There was no room above me except empty air and a steep roof. But the music continued for 20 minutes before fading. The next night it started again at ten thirty PM. This time it was violin like old ballrooms and forgotten waltz partners. Standing on my ladder, I could swear I heard multiple sets of footsteps moving in patterns like dancers. I called my landlord, Missus Patterson. There's no attic above your unit, dear, she said patiently. The roof structure doesn't allow for it. Are you sure the sound isn't coming from outside? It's definitely coming from above my ceiling. That evening I recruited my downstairs Neighbour Kevin to help investigate. You hear that, right? I asked as the piano music began. Kevin stood in my kitchen, head tilted. I don't hear anything. The piano music. It's right above us. He looked at me with genuine concern. Melissa, there's no music. Are you feeling okay? After he left, I researched the building's history. The Victorian house had been built in 1898 by Theodore Whitmore. His daughter Constance had been a promising pianist who'd studied at the conservatory. In 1923, Constance had fallen from the attic window during a party, dying instantly. The newspaper mentioned she'd been heard playing piano in the attic that evening, despite the family's piano being downstairs. A party guest was quoted. Miss Whitmore claimed the attic had better acoustics than any concert hall. After Constance's death, the family reported piano music at all hours from the empty attic. Theodore had the space permanently sealed in 1924, installing a false ceiling. My apartment ceiling was that false ceiling. The music came every night, always starting at ten thirty PM. I started recording it, but playback revealed only silence. One night, I bought a crowbar and carefully pried away ceiling tiles. Above the false ceiling was empty space. But in my flashlight beam, I saw something impossible. Furniture, a piano, sheet music, even a small chandelier. I enlarged the hole. The space was configured like a Victorian attic room. Slanted ceiling, dormer windows that shouldn't exist, polished wooden floors and sitting at an ornate Piano was a young woman in a 1920s white dress. She was playing a piece I'd never heard, her fingers moving across keys that made no recordable sound. Her dark hair was finger waved, her posture perfect. She stopped playing and turned around. Constance Whitmore looked exactly like her newspaper photograph, except her eyes were completely black. You can hear my music, she said. No one has heard it in so long. How is this possible? Music transcends physical boundaries. It exists in spaces between what is and what was. I've been playing here since 1923, waiting for someone with the right ears. She began another piece, beautiful and sorrowful. The fall wasn't an accident. I jumped. The music in my head was too loud, too demanding. But you're still here. The music trapped me. It needed someone to play it. I've been its vessel for a century. I found myself climbing through the hole into the impossible attic space. The room was exactly as it had been in 1923. Persian rugs, antique furniture. Sheet music dated from that era. But the windows showed Rolling Hills under perpetual twilight. This is where the music lives, Constance explained, in the space that was overlapping the space that is. I approached the piano. Will you play with me? I sat beside her. Though I'd never Learned piano, my fingers seemed to know where to go. We played together, a duet that had never been written. But it always existed. The music wasn't just Sound. It was emotion given form, memory made tangible. And it was hungry. It had kept Constance here for a century, and now it wanted me, too. I should go, I said, pulling away from the keys. Of course, Constance said sadly. But you'll be back. The music knows you now. That was two weeks ago. Every night I hear Constance playing in the Impossible Attic. And every night the music gets louder, more insistent. I've started climbing back up there. The duets we play are unlike anything I've ever heard. My friends say I've been acting strange lately. Distant, obsessed with music. I can't explain. But I know Constance is waiting, her fingers poised over keys that play melodies from beyond existence. And the music is so beautiful. I think tonight I'll stay in the attic a little longer, just until the song is finished.",

    "subtitle_transcription": "לזר בדלת שלי הייתה השן החסרה שלי על שרשרת. איבדתי את הטוחנת השמאלית העליונה שלי לפני חצי שנה במהלך תאונת אופניים בשביל שמאחורי הבית שלי. פגע בשורש שגוי, עבר מעל הכידון ונחת פנים ראשונות על החצץ. השן נסדקה לשניים, והייתי צריך לחלץ אותו למחרת. ד \"ר ברנן הציעה לשמור את זה בשבילי. יש אנשים ששומרים על שיניהם מסיבות סנטימנטליות, הוא אמר, אבל אמרתי לו להיפטר מזה. כל החוויה הייתה טראומטית מספיק בלי לשמור על תזכורת עקובה מדם. אז כשהאישה ליד דלתי אתמול בערב הרימה שרשרת כסף עם טוחנת צהובה המשתלשלת ממנה, האינסטינקט הראשון שלי היה בלבול ולא פחד. זה שלך? נותן לשן להתנדנד מעט באור המרפסת. היא הייתה אולי בת 40, עם שיער מאפיר משוך לאחור בלחמניה הדוקה, ובגדים שנראו יקרים אך מיושנים. החיוך שלה היה רחב מדי, מראה שיניים שהיו ישרות ולבנות באופן טבעי. אני מצטער, מה? השן, אמרה בסבלנות. בהיתי בתליון השיניים. זה בהחלט היה טוחנת אנושית, וזה נראה מוכר באופן מטריד. אותו גודל, אותו שינוי צבע קל. נזכרתי מהפה שלי. מאיפה השגת את זה? כמובן. חיוכה התרחב ככל הנראה. לפני שישה חודשים, שבועיים ושלושה ימים. היית די זהיר עם זה. הספציפיות של ציר הזמן גרמה לבטן שלי להתכופף זה היה בדיוק כשאיבדתי את השן. תראה, אני לא יודע איזה סוג של הונאה זה, אבל. אין הונאה, היא קטעה. אני כאן כדי להחזיר את הרכוש שלך. אם כי אני חייב לומר שהיית מאוד חסר אחריות עם החלקים שלך. היא הושיטה יד לארנק ושלפה שקית קטיפה קטנה. ממנה היא משכה שרשרת אחרת, זה שמחזיק מה שנראה כמו גזירת ציפורניים. זה מיום שלישי שעבר. נשכת את זה בזמן שצפית בטלוויזיה. בזבזני מאוד, משאיר את זה על כרית הספה ככה. אכן נשכתי ציפורניים כשהייתי עצבני, וצפיתי במותחן אינטנסיבי במיוחד בשבוע שעבר. אבל הרעיון שמישהו היה בבית שלי אוסף את חלקי גופי שהושלכו. מי אתה? אני אספן, היא אמרה בפשטות. גם אם אתה לא מבין את זה. שיער מהמברשת שלך, תאי עור מהסדינים שלך, דגימת הדם המקסימה ההיא מאז שחתכת את עצמך בגילוח בחודש שעבר. היד שלי הלכה אינסטינקטיבית ללסת שלי, שם כיניתי את עצמי בתער חדש. זה היה חתך זעיר, בקושי שווה תחבושת. אתה מטורף, אני מתקשר למשטרה. זה לא יהיה הכרחי. היא אמרה, הטון שלה נשאר בשיחה. אני לא כאן כדי לפגוע בך. אני כאן כדי להזהיר אותך. על מה שקורה כשמישהו אוסף מספיק חתיכות ממך. היא הרימה את השן שוב, נותן לו לתפוס את האור D N A. זה דבר כל כך נפלא. כל כך הרבה מידע ארוז בשברים זעירים כאלה. עם מספיק דוגמאות, אתה יכול לעשות דברים מדהימים. היא הושיטה שוב יד לארנקה ושלפה בקבוקון זכוכית קטן מלא במה שנראה כמו דם. שלך מגזרת התער, בשילוב עם השיער, העור, גזרי הציפורניים. בואו נגיד שיש לי מספיק חומר לעבוד איתו עכשיו. לעבוד עם מה? החיוך שלה קיבל איכות טורפת. כדי להפוך אותך אחר, כמובן. אתה טוב יותר. כזה שלא מבזבז כל כך הרבה מעצמו. צעדתי אחורה והושיט יד לטלפון שלי. אבל כשעברתי, הבחנתי במשהו שגרם לדם שלי לקפוא. הצל של האישה במרפסת שלי לא התאים לגופה. בזמן שהיא עמדה דוממת לחלוטין, הצל שלה זז, מחווה, מושיט לעברי באצבעות מוארכות. התהליך כבר החל, אמרה בעקבות מבטי. החומר הביולוגי שלך די מגיב. הוא רוצה להיות שלם שוב, אתה רואה. זה רוצה לחזור הביתה. זה בלתי אפשרי. אתה כבר מרגיש עייף בזמן האחרון, תברח? זה בגלל שחלקים ממך נמצאים במקום אחר. לומד, גדל, הופך להיות. כל יצירה שאספתי נושאת שבר מהמהות שלך. היא צדקה לגבי העייפות. הרגשתי סחוט במשך שבועות, בהנחה שמדובר בעבודה, לחץ או שינה לקויה. מה אתה רוצה ממני? היא אמרה. אם כי עלי להזכיר את החדש שאתה כמעט שלם. היא מתאמנת בגינונים שלך. ללמוד את ההרגלים שלך. היא אפילו יודעת על המפתח הרזרבי מתחת לשטיח האחורי שלך. מעולם לא סיפרתי לאף אחד על המפתח הזה. היא ביקרה בזמן שאתה בעבודה. האישה המשיכה. לובש את הבגדים שלך, לאכול את האוכל שלך, לישון במיטה שלך, להרגיש בנוח עם החיים שהיא עומדת לרשת. אתה משקר. בדוק את תאריך תפוגת החלב שלך כשאתה חוזר פנימה. קנית אותו לפני שלושה ימים. אבל זה יפוג מחר. זה בגלל שהיא שתתה את זה. לחיות את חייך בהיעדרך. מוחי דהר, מנסה לזכור פרטים מהשבועות האחרונים. האם האוכל שלי נעלם מהר מהרגיל? האם מצאתי דברים זזים מעט מהמקום בו השארתי אותם? הדבר היפה בשחזור ביולוגי, האישה אמרה, היא שהעותק שומר על כל זיכרונות המקור. היא יודעת כל מה שאתה יודע. מרגיש כל מה שאתה מרגיש. כאשר המעבר קורה, אף אחד לא ישים לב להבדל. כאשר המעבר קורה? הערב בשעה 3: 00 בבוקר, אם לדייק. אז התהליך מסתיים. החדש שתשתלט עליו, ואת הישן פשוט תדעך. כמו צילום שמאבד את בהירותו עד שהוא ריק לחלוטין. היא תחבה את השן לארנק שלה. רציתי להחזיר לך את זה לפני זה. באדיבות מקצועית. היית כזה תורם מצוין. איך אני עוצר את זה? הצחוק שלה היה כמו שבירת זכוכית. התהליך הוא ביולוגי, בלתי הפיך. ה- DNA שלך רוצה שזה יקרה. נמאס לי להתפזר. הוא רוצה להיות שלם. היא פנתה לעזוב ואז עצרה. עוד דבר אחד. כשתפגשי אותה, ובקרוב מאוד, אל תפחד. היא אתה, אחרי הכל. פשוט השתפר. יעיל יותר, פחות בזבזני. רגע, התקשרתי. אבל היא כבר הלכה בחניה שלי. ראיתי אותה נכנסת למכונית סדאן לבנה שחונה מעבר לרחוב. כשנסעה משם הבחנתי במשהו במושב הנוסע. דמות שנראתה בדיוק כמוני, לובש בגדים שזיהיתי מהארון שלי. אני האחר נופף כשעברו. זה היה לפני 12 שעות. ואני יכול לשמוע מישהו מסתובב למטה. צעדים שתואמים בדיוק לשער שלי. מזמזם שיר שנתקעתי בראש כל השבוע. פחדתי מדי להסתכל. אבל אני יכול להריח את הקפה שלי מתבשל, לשמוע את שגרת הבוקר שלי מתחילה 18 דקות מוקדם. היא מתאמנת. הטלפון שלי פשוט זמזם עם טקסט מהמספר שלי. תחזרי לישון, אני אמשיך מכאן. אני כותב את זה מהר ככל האפשר. אם כי אני לא בטוח למה. אולי כהוכחה לכך שאני המקורי היה קיים. אולי כאזהרה לאחרים להיות זהירים יותר עם החלקים של עצמם שהם משאירים אחריהם. הראייה שלי מטושטשת, כאילו אני דוהה בקצוות. אני יכול לשמוע אותה עולה במדרגות עכשיו, ואיכשהו אני יודע שהיא נושאת כוס קפה שעשויה בדיוק כמו שאני אוהב את זה. הצעדים נעצרו מחוץ לדלת שלי. אל תפחד, אומר הקול שלי מהמסדרון. אני הולך לטפל בנו הרבה יותר טוב. ידית הדלת מסתובבת עכשיו. אני חושב שאני מוכן לפגוש את עצמי.",

    "subtitle_transcription": "Split second decision changed your life. I was in line at the pharmacy when I heard the cashier telling this teenage girl her insurance wouldn't cover her insulin. The girl started crying and begging saying she only had $12. Normally I mind my own business. I had my own problems, just got divorced, barely making rent. But watching this kid panic about something she needed to survive just broke me. Without thinking, I step forward and handed the cashier my credit card. Put it on here. The girl looked shocked and tried to refuse, but I insisted. She wrote down my number and promised to pay me back. I figured I'd never hear from her again and that was fine. Three days later, she calls me sobbing. Turns out her mom had been stealing her insulin money for drugs. This set 17 year old was literally dying because her own mother chose addiction over her daughter's life. I told her to pack whatever she could and come stay with me until we figured something out. My ex wife thought I was crazy for taking in a random kid, but I couldn't just walk away. The first week was rough. Sarah barely spoke, just sat in my spare room doing homework. Then child services showed up at my door. Her mother had reported me for kidnapping her daughter. I almost lost Sarah right there. The case worker was this stern woman named Mrs. Putin who grilled me for two hours. Why Would a divorced man take in a teenage girl he doesn't know? I explained everything, showed her the pharmacy receipt, even called the pharmacist as a witness. Turns out Sarah had been lying to me. She.",

    "subtitle_transcription": "eleven year old Daniel sulked in the backseat arms crossed earbuds blasting static instead of music outside the window the green hills of the countryside passed like a taunt no skyscrapers no honking horns no corner store with cold sodas and familiar faces just fields trees silence his parents chirped about fresh air and new beginnings from the front seat but Daniel didn't care he'd left his friends his skatepark his life the new house was old and creaky nestled between an overgrown lawn and a wall of trees that loomed like centuries his little sister Ellie bounded out of the car with delight spinning in the long grass and chasing butterflies Daniel scowled come on Danny his dad said with forced cheer we've got woods right in our backyard you always wanted to explore right I wanted to explore New York City not a pile of sticks his mom crouched to meet his eyes there's beauty here if you give it a chance he didn't respond just shoved past them into the house that night while Ellie giggled with their mom in the kitchen and his dad hung wind chimes from the porch Daniel sat in his room staring at the wall boredom burned a hole in his chest he needed his friends splitting a cigarette with Mark behind the garage the thrill and mystery of the city anything but the deafening silence of a house in the middle of the goddamn woods the next morning Daniel skipped breakfast he couldn't bear to fake another smile over his mother's overcooked scrambled eggs that the rest of the family praised he slipped out the back door determined for adventure the large swaying tree in the distance called to him he pushed his way through the brush the fine brush slapping back at him as he trudged forward the further he went the quieter everything became the birds hushed the air grew still that's when he came upon it a giant birch tree its white bark flaking like old skin stood alone in a small clearing halfway up almost hidden by the leaves was a crooked treehouse jagged wooden planks had been nailed into the trunk as steps most were grey with rot one hung by a single nail swaying curiosity overpowered his caution he began to climb testing each step with his foot before putting weight on it the wind whispered through the branches groaning softly when he reached the top and pushed open the hatch he froze a man was already up there middle aged grimy beard yellowed eyes he sat cross legged in the corner smiling Daniel back toward the hatch I sorry I didn't know anyone it's quite alright the man said voice warm not many kids come out here anymore you new around here Daniel hesitated something about the man's voice was calming familiar even yeah we just moved in tough move he nodded slowly the man patted the wooden floor beside him have a seat kiddo I don't bite I used to spend a lot of time up here as a kid the man said built this place with my brothers we used to sneak up here tell stories have a smoke he smiled pulling a crumpled pack of cigarettes from his pocket want one Daniel's eyes widened a cigarette it reminded him of those times with Mark rebellious powerful he slowly reached out the man's hand clamped around his wrist like a vice before Daniel could scream the man pulled him in close his arm tightening around Daniel's neck don't scream it'll just make it worse for you he growled into Daniel's ear Daniel kicked elbowed clawed the man's grip tightened shadows started to creep into the corners of his vision with one final desperate thrash Daniel slipped from the man's grasp he tumbled backward crashing through the hatch down down he hit the ground with a crack the wind knocked from his lungs he sat up terrified but unscathed there wasn't time to acknowledge pain the adrenaline now pumping through his veins overwhelmed him with one instinct run and he did leaping over giant roots that broke the surface of the forest floor he didn't look back not even when he heard the man's howling scream echo through the trees eventually he burst into a sun drenched clearing a lake shimmered ahead children played in the water laughing splashing the air smelled like honeysuckle in summer it felt like magic it felt like home two boys ran up to him grinning hey you're new one asked come swim the other shouted Daniel almost out of breath told them about the attack in the treehouse they could all be found they must hide one of the boys said here we've got each other nobody can touch us Daniel's fear melted into the shadows of his mind he dove into the water laughing the boys swam and skipped rocks that danced across the water like dragonflies it felt like he'd known them forever but then time passed the sky dimmed I should go home Daniel said they looked at him solemn now are you sure he nodded my parents will be worried he crept back through the woods doing his best to summon his internal compass but mostly looking for the giant birch tree and the monster that resided up in it luckily he stumbled across the house before crossing path with that tree or the man lurking within it lights on front door open he stepped inside mom he called dad they were at the dinner table Ellie was there too but they didn't look up didn't smile guys he whispered nothing they finally lost their patience with him his refusal to follow the rules sneaking out from the house testing their patience at all costs he went to reach for his mom's arm but she got up with her plate disappearing into the kitchen over the next few days Daniel watched as his parents grew thinner quieter he'd really done it this time then one day as he wandered the woods again he passed the birch tree the treehouse was gone only the nails remained rusted and bent stained with something dark he walked toward the lake again and when he arrived the other children turned to him one girl her skin pale and damp spoke softly he got you too huh Daniel confused furrowed his brow it's okay she said you're safe now behind them the man's scream echoed faintly through the trees forever searching forever howling but he would never find the lake and Daniel once lost to the world was finally found",
